        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! 
            Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I 
            announce we're having these for dinner. 
            The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, 
            we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and 
            Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>
        <p>This top-rated chicken burger recipe is a refreshing change from traditional beef burgers. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground chicken</strong>: This recipe starts with a pound of extra-lean ground chicken.</li>
